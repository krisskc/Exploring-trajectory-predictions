# Exploring-trajectory-predictions
In this with the particular focus on multi-user multi-step trajectory prediction, we first design a basic deep learning-based prediction framework, where the long short-term memory and  (LSTM) network is directly applied as the most critical component to learn user-specific mobility pattern from the user's historical trajectories and predict his/her movement trends in the future. Motivated by this we propose a multi-user multi-step trajectory prediction framework by further incorporating the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning and Extreme Learning MachineÂ (ELM).
The data we are using in this project is extracted from a bigger source and is manipulated to our requirement.
